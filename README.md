# SEDust  

**SEDust** is a Python pipeline for fitting spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of evolved stars using the **DUSTY** radiative transfer code.  
It is designed to estimate **luminosities**, **optical depths**, and **mass-loss rates** for AGB and LPV stars, based on multi-band photometric data.  

---

## âœ¨ Features
- Fits observed stellar photometry with a pre-computed grid of **60,000 DUSTY models**.  
- Handles both **carbon-rich** and **oxygen-rich** stars.  
- Returns best-fit **SEDs**, **luminosities**, and **mass-loss rates**.  
- Automated pipeline: no trial-and-error fitting required.  
- Higher resolution compared to DESK code.
